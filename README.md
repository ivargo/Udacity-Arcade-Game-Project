## Run and play the game

To run the game, open index.html in your browser.

Immediately enemies start moving from left to right at different speed across the block of a paveway.

The player character is positioned at bottom right of the board, on the grass field. By using key arrows left, right, up and down, you move the character across the board.

If the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square.

The aim of the game is the player to reach the water at the top of the game board. When a game is won, a message appears prompting for a replay.
